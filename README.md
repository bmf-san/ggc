## Overview

ggc is a Git tool written in Go, offering both traditional CLI commands and an interactive interface with incremental search. You can either run subcommands like ggc add directly, or launch the interactive mode by simply typing ggc. Designed to be fast, user-friendly, and extensible.

## Features

- Traditional command-line interface (CLI): Run ggc <command> [args] to execute specific operations directly.
- Interactive interface: Run ggc with no arguments to launch an incremental search UI for command selection.
- Simple commands for common Git operations (add, push, pull, branch, log, etc.)
- Composite commands that combine multiple Git operations
- Interactive UI for branch/file selection and message input
- Implemented using the Go standard library and:
    - [golang.org/x/term](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/term) ‚Äì for terminal interaction
    - [golang.org/x/sys](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/sys) ‚Äì for low-level OS interaction
    - [gopkg.in/yaml.v3](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/yaml.v3) ‚Äì for parsing `~/.ggcconfig.yaml`

## Supported Environments
- OS: macOS (Apple Silicon/Intel) - Verified
- Go version: 1.24 or later recommended
- Dependencies: Go standard library, `golang.org/x/term`, `golang.org/x/sys`, `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`
- Requirement: `git` command must be installed

## Installation

### Pre-compiled Binaries (Recommended)

Pre-compiled binaries are available for multiple platforms and architectures. This is the fastest way to get started with `ggc`.

#### Download from Releases
Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/bmf-san/ggc/releases/) page to download the latest binary for your platform:

#### Supported Platforms:

- macOS: `darwin_amd64` (Intel), `darwin_arm64` (Apple Silicon)
- Linux: `linux_amd64`, `linux_arm64`
- Windows: `windows_amd64`

### Quick Install with Script

The easiest way to install `ggc` is using the provided installation script:

```sh
# Download and run the installation script
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmf-san/ggc/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or download and run it manually:

```sh
# Download the script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmf-san/ggc/main/install.sh

# Make it executable
chmod +x install.sh

# Run the script
./install.sh
```

The script will:
- Detect your operating system and architecture
- Download the appropriate binary for your system
- Install using `go install`, manual install fallback
- Verify the installation

### Build with make

```sh
git clone <repository URL>
make build
```

Place the `ggc` binary in a directory included in your PATH.

### Development Setup

For development, you can use the Makefile to install required tools and dependencies:

```sh
# Install all dependencies and tools
make deps

# Run formatter
make fmt

# Run tests
make test

# Run linter
make lint

# Run tests with coverage
make cover

# Run tests and lint
make test-and-lint

# Build with go build
make build

# Build and run with version info
make run
```

The Makefile will automatically install required tools like `golangci-lint` using `go install`.

### Global install with go install

```sh
go install github.com/bmf-san/ggc@latest
```

- The `ggc` binary will be installed to `$GOBIN` (usually `$HOME/go/bin`).
- If `$GOBIN` is in your `PATH`, you can use `ggc` from anywhere.
- If not, add it to your `PATH`:

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOBIN)
# or
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
```

## Usage

### Interactive Command Selection (Incremental Search UI)

Just run:

```sh
ggc
```

- Type to filter commands (incremental search)
- Use ctrl+n/ctrl+p to move selection, Enter to execute
- If a command requires arguments (e.g. `<file>`, `<name>`, `<url>`), you will be prompted for input (always left-aligned)
- After command execution, results are displayed and you can press Enter to continue
- After viewing results, you return to the command selection screen for continuous use
- Use "quit" command or ctrl+c to exit interactive mode
- All UI and prompts are in English
