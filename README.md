## Overview

ggc is a Git tool written in Go, offering both traditional CLI commands and an interactive interface with incremental search. You can either run subcommands like ggc add directly, or launch the interactive mode by simply typing ggc. Designed to be fast, user-friendly, and extensible.

## Features

- Traditional command-line interface (CLI): Run ggc <command> [args] to execute specific operations directly.
- Interactive interface: Run ggc with no arguments to launch an incremental search UI for command selection.
- Simple commands for common Git operations (add, push, pull, branch, log, etc.)
- Composite commands that combine multiple Git operations
- Interactive UI for branch/file selection and message input
- Built with Go standard library and minimal dependencies

## Supported Environments
- OS: macOS (Apple Silicon/Intel) - Verified
- Go version: 1.25 or later recommended
- Requirement: `git` command must be installed

## Installation

### Pre-compiled Binaries (Recommended)

Pre-compiled binaries are available for multiple platforms and architectures. This is the fastest way to get started with `ggc`.

#### Download from Releases
Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/bmf-san/ggc/releases/) page to download the latest binary for your platform:

#### Supported Platforms:

- macOS: `darwin_amd64` (Intel), `darwin_arm64` (Apple Silicon)
- Linux: `linux_amd64`, `linux_arm64`
- Windows: `windows_amd64`

### Homebrew

Install via Homebrew (macOS Intel/Apple Silicon, Linux ARM64/x86_64):

```sh
brew install ggc
# Upgrade later:
# brew upgrade ggc
# Verify:
# ggc version
```

- Formula: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ggc
- Platforms: macOS (Apple Silicon/Intel), Linux (ARM64/x86_64)

### Quick Install with Script

The easiest way to install `ggc` is using the provided installation script:

```sh
# Download and run the installation script
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmf-san/ggc/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or download and run it manually:

```sh
# Download the script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmf-san/ggc/main/install.sh

# Make it executable
chmod +x install.sh

# Run the script
./install.sh
```

The script will:
- Detect your operating system and architecture
- Download the appropriate binary for your system
- Install using `git`, manual `go install` fallback
- Verify the installation

### Build with make

```sh
git clone <repository URL>
make build
```

Place the `ggc` binary in a directory included in your PATH.

### Development Setup

For development, you can use the Makefile to install required tools and dependencies:

```sh
# Install all dependencies and tools
make deps

# Run formatter
make fmt

# Run tests
make test

# Run linter
make lint

# Run tests with coverage
make cover

# Run tests and lint
make test-and-lint

# Build with go build
make build

# Build and run with version info
make run
```

The Makefile will automatically install required tools like `golangci-lint` using `go install`.

### Global install with go install

```sh
go install github.com/bmf-san/ggc/v6@latest
```

- The `ggc` binary will be installed to `$GOBIN` (usually `$HOME/go/bin`).
- If `$GOBIN` is in your `PATH`, you can use `ggc` from anywhere.
- If not, add it to your `PATH`:

> [!NOTE]
> When using `go install`, you may get limited version info due to `ldflags` not working with `go install`. It is recommended to build with make build or use the install script or binaries.

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOBIN)
# or
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
```

## Usage

### Interactive Command Selection (Fuzzy Search UI)

Just run:

```sh
ggc
```

**Search Features:**
- **Fuzzy matching**: Type any characters that appear in the command (e.g., `"bd"` matches `"branch delete"`, `"ca"` matches `"commit amend"`)
- **Case-insensitive**: Search works regardless of case
- **Real-time filtering**: Results update as you type

**Navigation & Editing:**
- `Ctrl+n` / `Ctrl+p`: Navigate up/down through results
- `←` / `→`: Move cursor left/right
- `Ctrl+←` / `Ctrl+→`: Move by word
- `Option+←` / `Option+→` (macOS): Move by word
- `Ctrl+a` / `Ctrl+e`: Move cursor to beginning/end of input
- `Ctrl+u`: Clear all input
- `Ctrl+w`: Delete word before cursor
- `Option+Backspace` (macOS): Delete word before cursor
- `Ctrl+k`: Delete from cursor to end of line
- `Backspace`: Delete character before cursor
- `Enter`: Execute selected command
- `Ctrl+c`: Exit interactive mode

**Command Execution:**
- If a command requires arguments (e.g. `<file>`, `<name>`, `<url>`), you will be prompted for input
- After command execution, results are displayed and you can press Enter to continue
- After viewing results, you return to the command selection screen for continuous use
- Type `"quit"` or use `Ctrl+c` to exit interactive mode
- All UI and prompts are in English

**Examples of Fuzzy Search:**
- `"bd"` → finds `"branch delete"`
- `"ca"` → finds `"commit amend"`
- `"ai"` → finds `"add interactive"`
- `"ss"` → finds `"status short"`
- `"brdel"` → finds `"branch delete"`

### Unified Syntax and “--” Separator

- Unified commands: ggc uses a flagless, space-separated syntax (no `-x`/`--long` options). Use subcommands and words, e.g., `ggc fetch prune`, `ggc commit allow empty`.
- Passing literals that begin with `-`: use the standard `--` separator to mark the end of options; everything after `--` is treated as data.
  - Example: `ggc commit -- - fix leading dash`

## Command Aliases

Chain multiple `ggc` commands together with custom aliases you define. Here is an example of aliases in your `~/.ggcconfig.yaml` file:
```yaml
aliases:
    ac:
        - add .
        - commit tmp
    br: branch
    ci: commit
    quick:
        - status
        - add .
        - commit tmp
    st: status
    sync:
        - pull current
        - add .
        - commit tmp
        - push current
```
For example, running `ggc ac` will execute first `ggc add .` then `ggc commit tmp` and terminate.

## Directory Structure

```
main.go                  # Entry point
router/                  # Command routing logic
cmd/                     # Command entry handlers
git/                     # Git operation wrappers
```

## Shell Completion

### Bash
Add the following to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`:
```bash
if [ -f "$(go env GOPATH)/pkg/mod/github.com/bmf-san/ggc/v6@*/tools/completions/ggc.bash" ]; then
  . "$(go env GOPATH)"/pkg/mod/github.com/bmf-san/ggc/v6@*/tools/completions/ggc.bash
fi
```

### Zsh
Add the following to your `~/.zshrc`:
```zsh
if [ -f "$(go env GOPATH)/pkg/mod/github.com/bmf-san/ggc/v6@*/tools/completions/ggc.zsh" ]; then
  . "$(go env GOPATH)"/pkg/mod/github.com/bmf-san/ggc/v6@*/tools/completions/ggc.zsh
fi
```

### Fish
Add the following to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:
```fish
if test -f (go env GOPATH)/pkg/mod/github.com/bmf-san/ggc/v6@*/tools/completions/ggc.fish
    source (go env GOPATH)/pkg/mod/github.com/bmf-san/ggc/v6@*/tools/completions/ggc.fish
end
```

This setup will automatically find the completion script regardless of the installed version.
